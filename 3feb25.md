## Time complexity
`Max(#swaps, #comparisons)`
### Recurrence relation
A recurrence relation is an equation that defines the solution (or time complexity) of a problem in terms of the solutions to its smaller subproblems, along with base cases.  
**Let's take Binary search as an example**   
- Base case: When the array size becomes very small (0 or 1 element):  
 `T(1) = 1`.  
 (Binary search takes constant time when only one element is left.)
- Recursive case: For an array of size n:  
  `T(n) = T(n/2) + 1`.  
  Meaning:  
  - `T(n/2)` → time to search in half the array.  
  - `+ 1` → constant work for comparing the middle element  

**This is the recurrence relation for binary search.**  
  
## Question 1
Q: write a prgram to insert or delete from any position of an array  
Solution (half):  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void insert(int num, int i, int *arr, int n)
{
    for (int in = n; in > i; in--)
    {
        arr[in] = arr[in - 1];
    }
    arr[i] = num;
}
int main()
{
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the length of array: ";
    cin >> n;
    int arr[n + 100];
    cout << "Enter the array: \n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    int insertions = 0;
    while (true)
    {
        cout << "Enter: \n1 to insert\n2 to delete\n3 to display the arry\n4. To exit\n: : ";
        int choice;
        cin >> choice;
        if (choice == 1)
        {
            cout << "Enter the number you want to insert :";
            int num;
            cin >> num;
            int index;
            cout << "Enter the index: ";
            cin >> index;
            insert(num, index, arr, n + insertions);
            insertions++;
        } else if(choice == 3){
            for (int i=0;i<(n+insertions);i++){
                cout << arr[i];
            }
        } 
        else{
            return false;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
